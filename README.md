# Tracking Global Carbon Emissions using CDIAC Data

The Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center was a Department of Energy project collecting data on US and global carbon emissions through 2016 when it was merged into a new DoE project called ESS-DIVE. CDIAC collected a variety of datasets on carbon emissions using a variety of different geographies, methodologies, and definitions. One study carried out under the auspices of the CDIAC was Global, Regional and National Fossil-Fuel CO2 Emissions (1751-2014) by Boden, Marland, and Andres. The study produced annual estimates of carbon emissions and carbon emissions per capita for the majority of the world’s countries, with some countries having data going back to 1751. 
We propose to use the data collected by Boden et al. to construct a global carbon emissions dashboard for the G20 countries using data from 1995 if possible to 2014 to establish trends and enable comparative study of carbon emissions per capita over that period. This would allow hypothetical policymakers to identify “worst offenders” in climate change, to identify geographic areas of concern, to gauge the effectiveness of national efforts to combat climate change over time, and to produce a persuasive illustration of the amount of carbon emissions being produced by industrialized countries in the new millennium.
